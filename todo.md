# Tour System — Product Roadmap & TODO

Last updated: 2026-05-19
Status key: `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done

---

## Phase 1 — Fix the Holes (Security & Stability)
> These are not features. The app is not production-safe without them.

- [x] **Staff gate on all dashboard views** — add `@staff_member_required` alongside `@login_required` on every dashboard view across `core`, `destinations`, `accommodations`, `activities`, `packages`. Any logged-in user can currently hit the dashboard.
- [x] **Login / logout views for the staff dashboard** — `@login_required` redirects to `/accounts/login/` which 404s. Staff cannot log in through the dashboard. Add Django's built-in auth URLs or a minimal custom login/logout view.
- [x] **Remove duplicate email config in `settings.py`** — `EMAIL_*` vars are defined twice (around line 110 and again at line 180). Delete the second block.
- [x] **Remove bare `pass` in exception handlers** — `packages/views.py:409, 414, 423, 428` silently swallow exceptions. At minimum log them with `logger.exception(...)`.
- [x] **Clean up template directory** — delete `templates/frontend/index_new.html` and `templates/frontend/index_old.html.bak`. Commit hygiene.

---

## Phase 2 — Revenue Loop (Core Business Gap)
> Inquiry system exists. Closing the booking loop is what makes this a product.

- [x] **Booking + Reservation model** — turn inquiries into confirmed bookings:
  - `Booking` model: links inquiry → package → passengers
  - Status workflow: `pending_deposit` → `deposit_paid` → `confirmed` → `in_progress` → `completed` → `cancelled` / `refunded`
  - Auto-generated booking reference (`BKG-YYYYMMDD-NNNNN`)
  - `Passenger` model: names, passport, DOB, dietary/medical, emergency contacts, lead passenger flag
  - Email triggers: booking confirmation, status change, payment received
  - Dashboard: staff can create/edit/cancel bookings, manage passengers and payments

- [x] **Payment tracking (manual first)** — before building a full gateway:
  - `Payment` model: type (deposit/balance/full/extra/refund), method (cash/bank/M-Pesa/card/Stripe), status, reference
  - Balance auto-calculated from confirmed payments vs quoted price
  - Status auto-advances: deposit recorded → `deposit_paid`, fully paid → `confirmed`

- [x] **Availability calendar** — packages need departure dates and seat limits:
  - `Departure` model: package + date + max_seats + booked_seats
  - Public listing shows available dates
  - Booking locks a seat on a departure
  - Sold out state auto-triggers from seat count

- [ ] **Payment gateway integration** — after manual tracking is proven:
  - Stripe for international (USD/EUR/GBP) clients
  - M-Pesa (Vodacom Tanzania) for local clients
  - Deposit + balance split payment flow

---

## Phase 3 — Mobile App (Token Auth)
> The README claims token auth exists. It does not.

- [x] **Token authentication** — `rest_framework.authtoken` + `TokenAuthentication` added to DRF; `/api/v1/auth/login/` returns DRF token for Flutter app
- [x] **Custom User model** — `accounts.CustomUser(AbstractUser)` with phone, profile_photo, preferred_currency, nationality; `AUTH_USER_MODEL` set; DB wiped and rebuilt
- [x] **Auth API endpoints** — register, login (token), logout, profile (GET/PATCH), change-password (rotates token)
- [x] **Customer-facing API endpoints** — bookings, saved packages, inquiry status for the Flutter app (next iteration)

---

## Phase 4 — Reviews + AI (Differentiators)

- [x] **Reviews app** — implement the stub:
  - `Review` model: Package + User + Booking + rating (1–5) + title/body + photos
  - Staff moderation: approve (publishes + updates package rating) / reject (with reason) / delete
  - Aggregate rating auto-updated in `Package.rating_average` via `update_rating()`
  - JSON-LD schema markup for Google rich snippets (AggregateRating)
  - Public display with rating breakdown, star filter, sort; submit form with eligibility check
  - REST API: GET approved reviews per package, POST create review (token auth)

- [x] **AI Assistant app** — implement the stub, all as async Celery tasks:
  - **PDF parser**: upload lodge PDF brochure → auto-populate `Accommodation` fields
  - **Itinerary generator**: destination + duration + budget → draft day-by-day itinerary
  - **Custom quote builder**: AI suggests packages from inquiry requirements
  - **Route optimizer**: selected parks/destinations → optimal driving order suggestion

---

## Phase 5 — Growth & Polish

- [x] **SEO meta tags in templates** — base templates don't use the `meta_title` / `meta_description` fields that are on every model. Wire `get_meta_title()` and `get_meta_description()` into `<head>`. Free organic traffic.
- [x] **Sitemap** — add Django's sitemaps framework for destinations, packages, activities. Submittable to Google Search Console.
- [ ] **Multi-currency display** — `Package` model already has currency choices. Wire to exchange rates so the public site shows prices in visitor's currency.
- [ ] **Analytics dashboard** — `view_count` is already tracked on every model. Surface it:
  - Most viewed packages / destinations
  - Inquiry → booking conversion rate
  - Revenue by month
  - Top traffic sources
- [ ] **Inquiry auto-follow-up** — Celery Beat jobs:
  - Immediate confirmation email to customer on inquiry submit
  - Follow-up if no staff reply in 48 hours
  - Escalation alert to manager at 72 hours
- [ ] **Newsletter campaigns** — use the existing `NewsletterSubscriber` list to send targeted promotions (new packages, seasonal offers)

---

## Phase 6 — Frontend Visual Overhaul (Safari Editorial)
> Replace the Ravelo Bootstrap template with a modern, cinematic Safari-editorial UI built on Tailwind + Alpine + GSAP + Lenis. Backend untouched — Django templates only.

**Direction:** Safari Editorial (National Geographic vibe — warm earth tones, serif headlines, magazine-style layouts)
**Photography:** Stock/Unsplash to start, swap to commissioned later
**Dev environment:** Docker stack at `http://localhost:8080`

### Stack decisions
- Keep: Django 5.2 templates, Leaflet (maps), Font Awesome (icons)
- Add: Tailwind CSS (PostCSS build), Alpine.js, GSAP + ScrollTrigger, Lenis (smooth scroll), django-imagekit (responsive images), variable fonts (Fraunces + Inter)
- Remove (gradually as pages are migrated): jQuery, Bootstrap JS, AOS, Slick, Magnific Popup, nice-select, jquery-ui

### Design principles (enforced on every page)
- One hero per page, full-bleed, real photography
- Generous whitespace
- Display serif (Fraunces) for headings, Inter for body
- Slow, deliberate motion (0.6–1.2s eases)
- Mobile-first
- Progressive enhancement (works without JS)
- Perf budget: LCP <2s, CSS <100kb, JS <80kb (excl GSAP)
- Accessibility WCAG AA (keyboard nav, contrast 4.5:1, alt text)

### Phase 6.0 — Foundation & Design System (2 days)
Branch: `feature/frontend-foundation` → PR → `develop`
- [x] Install Tailwind CSS via `pytailwindcss` (standalone CLI v4, no Node) — uses inline `@theme` instead of `tailwind.config.js`
- [x] Configure Safari Editorial tokens — full sand/bush/clay 50–900 ramps + ivory, bone, mist, charcoal, graphite
- [x] Install Alpine.js (3.14.3) + GSAP (3.12.5) + ScrollTrigger + Lenis (1.1.20) to `static/frontend/vendor/`
- [x] Add Google variable fonts — Fraunces (display) + Inter (body), preconnect tuned
- [x] Built new `base_modern.html` from scratch (legacy `base.html` left untouched; pages migrate one-by-one in 6.1+)
- [x] Created reusable partials: `_nav.html`, `_footer.html`, `_button.html`, `_card.html`, `_section_header.html`
- [x] Installed + configured `django-imagekit` (`imagekit` in INSTALLED_APPS)
- [x] Built `_styleguide.html` at `/styleguide/` (DEBUG-only, returns 404 in production)

### Phase 6.1 — Homepage (3 days)
Branch: `feature/frontend-homepage` → PR → `develop`
- [x] Cinematic hero — full-bleed Tanzania photo, Ken Burns zoom, GSAP staggered headline fade, scroll cue
- [x] Sticky nav that morphs on scroll (transparent → solid) — already done in Phase 6.0 partial
- [x] Featured destinations asymmetric magazine grid (1 hero card + 4 secondary) with hover zoom + caption reveal
- [x] Featured packages large editorial cards with price, duration, category eyebrow, hover arrow
- [x] Activities preview — horizontal scroll showcase with difficulty badge + category eyebrow
- [x] Stats trust strip — 4 scroll-triggered GSAP counters (destinations, tours, activities, lodges)
- [x] Testimonials section — 3-up quote cards with photo, location, star rating
- [x] Editorial pull-quote section (charcoal background) — "Why us" + 3 value pillars
- [x] Final CTA strip — full-bleed bush-green with mix-blend overlay, double CTA

### Phase 6.2 — Listing Pages (2 days)
Branch: `feature/frontend-listings` → PR → `develop`
- [x] `destinations/list.html` — Safari Editorial, sticky filter sidebar, country + search filters
- [x] `packages/list.html` — 6-filter sidebar (search, category, difficulty, destination, price range, days range, sort)
- [x] `activities/list.html` — search + category + difficulty + destination filters; difficulty badge on each card
- [x] `accommodations/list.html` — search + type + star rating + destination; star-rating badge on each card
- [x] Sticky filter sidebar (desktop, `lg:sticky top-28`) + Alpine.js mobile toggle slide-up
- [x] Active-filter pills with × dismiss (destination list — pattern reusable)
- [x] Shared `_listing_hero`, `_listing_pagination`, `_listing_empty` partials
- [ ] Grid ↔ list view toggle (deferred — not needed for v1)

### Phase 6.3 — Detail Pages (3 days)
Branch: `feature/frontend-detail-pages` → PR → `develop`
- [x] `packages/detail.html` — sticky booking sidebar (price + departures + facts), itinerary timeline with day markers, inclusions/exclusions, gallery, in-page CTA, related tours
- [x] `destinations/detail.html` — magazine-style long form (about, wildlife, climate, gallery), sticky quick-facts card, Leaflet map, activities + accommodations grids, related destinations
- [x] `activities/detail.html` — hero with difficulty + duration + min age, sticky price card, requirements/included/excluded, gallery, related activities
- [x] `accommodations/detail.html` — hero with star rating, sticky stay-here card, rooms list with prices + bed/occupancy/size, amenities, gallery, related lodges
- [x] Shared partials added: `_detail_hero.html`, `_gallery.html`, `_related_grid.html`

### Phase 6.4 — Conversion Flows (2 days)
Branch: `feature/frontend-conversion` → PR → `develop`
- [x] Inquiry form — 4-step Alpine.js wizard (single POST), progress bar with %, step labels, prev/next/submit nav, trust line at bottom
- [x] Contact page — `[1.4fr_1fr]` split layout: form left (name/email/phone/subject/message), info card + 3-step "what to expect" + Leaflet map of Arusha on right
- [x] Custom package quote view — token-protected page styled for clients receiving a tailor-made quote; sticky price-and-actions sidebar (Accept &amp; Book / Request changes), itinerary timeline, expiry banners
- [x] Inquiry success page — branded confirmation with reference card, 3-step "what happens next" timeline, links back to tours
- [x] Shared `_form_field.html` partial + base styles for all inputs/selects/textareas (Tailwind component layer)

### Phase 6.5 — Static Pages + Auth (1 day)
Branch: `feature/frontend-static` → PR → `develop`
- [x] **About us** — new `/about/` route + template. Cinematic hero, story section, 3 values cards (Local / Bespoke / Honest pricing), team grid placeholder, bush-green final CTA. Wired into nav + footer.
- [x] **FAQ** — category filter chips (with counts), Alpine.js accordion with single-open behaviour and smooth `x-transition`, "still stuck" CTA strip
- [x] **404** — branded "That trail's overgrown" page with helpful nav links
- [x] **500** — self-contained branded server-error page (doesn't extend base_modern since RequestContext isn't guaranteed)
- [x] **Staff dashboard login** — clean 2-col split (brand panel left with safari image + pull-quote, form right), Safari Editorial palette but utility-app feel

### Phase 6.6 — Polish & Performance (2 days)
Branch: `feature/frontend-polish` → PR → `develop`
- [x] Migrated last 3 templates off legacy base.html (reviews list + submit, newsletter unsubscribe)
- [x] **Deleted legacy Ravelo assets** — 17MB → 1.2MB of static assets (93% reduction): all old CSS (bootstrap, aos, slick, magnific-popup, nice-select, jquery-ui, flaticon, style), all old JS (jquery, bootstrap, slick, magnific, isotope, appear, skill.bars, imagesloaded, form-validator), the entire `assets/php/` + `assets/sass/` + most of `assets/images/` (kept only logos/), flaticon font files, plus FA `.eot/.svg/.ttf/.woff` variants (kept only `.woff2`)
- [x] **Deleted legacy templates** — `templates/frontend/base.html`, `templates/frontend/partials/header.html`, `templates/frontend/partials/footer.html`
- [x] Skip-to-content link in base_modern.html (sr-only by default, focus-revealed)
- [x] `<main id="content" tabindex="-1">` so the skip link actually focuses
- [x] `robots.txt` route + sitemap reference + admin/dashboard/api disallow
- [x] Mobile pass via Playwright at 390×844 (iPhone 14 width)
- [x] Perf check: HTML 20 KB · Tailwind CSS 55 KB · Vendor JS 171 KB — well within budget
- [ ] Lighthouse audit (not run — no CLI in this env; user can run from browser)
- [ ] Cross-browser test (Playwright only ships Chromium here; user can spot-check Safari + Firefox)
- [ ] Image optimization pipeline via django-imagekit (deferred to when real photos are uploaded)

**Phase 6 complete.** All 9 public route groups now live on `base_modern.html` with the Safari Editorial system.

**Total estimate:** 13–15 focused days, 7 PRs to `develop`.

---

## Phase 7 — Dashboard Visual Overhaul (Operations Slate)
> Apply a parallel design system to the internal staff dashboard. Built on the same Tailwind v4 + Alpine.js foundation as Phase 6, but with a denser, cooler, productivity-tool feel. Backend untouched — Django templates only.

**Direction:** Operations Slate (Stripe-meets-Linear — cool neutrals, dense layouts, semantic status colours, no editorial motion)
**Palette continuity:** keeps `bush-600` from Safari Editorial for brand consistency; everything else is fresh
**Dev environment:** existing Docker stack at `http://localhost:8080/dashboard/`

### Stack decisions
- Keep: Tailwind v4, Alpine.js, Font Awesome
- Add: **Chart.js** (~60 KB) for analytics dashboard charts
- Drop in dashboard context: GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis (no cinematic motion in productivity tools)
- Typography: **Inter only** (no Fraunces); 14px base body (vs 16px on public)

### Operations Slate tokens (full list)
- **Backgrounds**: `slate-50` page bg, `white` cards, `slate-100` hover rows, `slate-200/300` borders
- **Text**: `slate-900` headings, `slate-700` body, `slate-500` labels/secondary
- **Brand**: `bush-600` for primary actions, active nav, focus rings; `bush-50` for primary hover
- **Semantic**: `emerald-500` success, `amber-500` warning, `rose-500` danger, `sky-500` info
- **Dark mode**: deferred to Phase 8

### Design principles (enforced on every dashboard page)
- Information density over whitespace
- Single accent colour (`bush-600`); no decorative gradients
- Transitions 150–250ms only — no scroll-triggered reveals
- Semantic status badges always use the semantic colour scale, never the brand accent
- Inline edit / quick actions preferred over modal flows
- Every list page has: search, filter pills, bulk-action bar, empty state, pagination

### Phase 7.0 — Foundation & Dashboard Styleguide (2 days)
Branch: `feature/dashboard-foundation` → PR → `develop`
- [x] Extended `tailwind.css` `@theme` — slate 50→900, semantic emerald/amber/rose/sky ramps. ~25 dashboard component classes (`dash-shell`, `dash-sidebar`, `dash-nav-link`, `dash-topbar`, `dash-page-title`, `dash-card`, `dash-stat`, `dash-btn`, `dash-btn-primary`, `dash-btn-danger`, `dash-badge` + variants, `dash-table`, `dash-input`, `dash-label`)
- [x] Chart.js 4.4.1 downloaded to `static/frontend/vendor/chart.min.js` (200 KB; loaded per-page, not globally)
- [x] Built `templates/backend/base_dashboard.html` — sidebar + topbar + main shell with Alpine off-canvas mobile nav + skip-to-content link + Django messages renderer
- [x] 8 reusable partials in `templates/backend/partials/` — `_dashboard_sidebar`, `_dashboard_topbar`, `_page_header`, `_breadcrumb`, `_stat_card`, `_status_badge`, `_empty_state`, `_data_table`
- [x] `/dashboard/styleguide/` page (DEBUG-only) showing every token, partial, badge, button, table, form field, motion guidance

### Phase 7.1 — Dashboard home (1–2 days)
Branch: `feature/dashboard-home` → PR → `develop`
- [x] **4-card KPI grid** — inquiries 30d, bookings 30d, revenue 30d, conversion %; each with vs-prior-30d trend chip (up/down arrow, signed %)
- [x] **Chart.js daily booking trend** — last 30 days, line chart with bush-green stroke + fill
- [x] **Chart.js revenue by month** — last 6 months, bar chart with bush hover state
- [x] **Recent inquiries table** — top 6 with status badges
- [x] **Recent bookings table** — top 6 with status badges and totals
- [x] **Action queue card** — pending inquiries / quotes awaiting send / unread messages with click-through
- [x] **Catalog totals card** — package / destination / activity / lodge counts, all clickable to their list pages
- [x] **Quick-create card** — 4 secondary buttons + primary "New booking" CTA

### Phase 7.2 — Dashboard listings (3–4 days · biggest sub-phase)
Branch: `feature/dashboard-listings` → PR → `develop`
- [x] All 12 dashboard list templates migrated to `base_dashboard.html`:
    - destinations, packages, activities, accommodations
    - inquiries, custom quotes, bookings, reviews
    - contacts, FAQs, newsletter, testimonials
- [x] Every list uses `.dash-table` for the data table + `.dash-input` / `.dash-select` for filters
- [x] Semantic status badges (via `_status_badge.html`) on every list with status
- [x] Status filter tabs with counts on inquiries, custom quotes, bookings, reviews, contacts, newsletter
- [x] Empty states with helpful CTAs via `_empty_state.html`
- [x] Per-row action buttons (edit / departures / delete / open / approve etc.)
- [x] Topbar "+ New X" CTAs on every applicable list
- [x] Pagination preserves filter querystring
- [ ] Sortable column headers — deferred to Phase 7.6 polish (not blocking; views still order by sensible defaults)
- [ ] Bulk-action toolbar — deferred to Phase 7.6 (only reviews + newsletter need it)
- [ ] Per-row Alpine dropdown menu — deferred (inline icon buttons work for v1)

### Phase 7.3 — Dashboard forms (2–3 days)
Branch: `feature/dashboard-forms` → PR → `develop`
- [x] **2-column layout** — form left (`1fr`), sticky publish sidebar right (`280px`) — saves/cancels/active toggle/featured toggle/danger zone
- [x] **Section cards** — every form is split into titled `dash-card`s (Basics / Pricing / Media / SEO, etc.)
- [x] **`.dash-form-field` wrapper class** — Tailwind component layer styles ALL input/select/textarea descendants so existing Django widget attrs (`form-control`) become visual no-ops; no widget rewrites needed
- [x] **Inline validation** — `dash-form-field--error` red border + per-field error list with `fa-exclamation-circle` icon
- [x] **Migrated 11 form templates**:
    - destinations · packages · activities · accommodations
    - faq · testimonial
    - booking · passenger
    - itinerary (package) · departure · custom-itinerary (custom quote)
- [x] Auto-render pattern via `{% for field in form %}` for the simpler forms; explicit section-by-section markup for packages (the most complex)
- [ ] Tabs for multi-section forms — deferred (Alpine.js tabs would be nice but section cards work well; revisit only if user feedback says forms are too long)

### Phase 7.4 — Dashboard detail pages (2 days)
Branch: `feature/dashboard-detail-pages` → PR → `develop`
- [x] **Booking detail** — header with reference + status badge, Customer card, Passengers table with row actions, Payments table with semantic status badges, Special requirements card, Staff notes (amber-tinted), sticky sidebar with financial summary (Total / Deposit / Paid / Balance) + Trip facts + Timeline
- [x] **Inquiry detail** — Customer + Trip request cards, Custom-quotes-for-this-inquiry list, threaded Messages with reply form, sticky sidebar with InquiryManagementForm + contact preferences
- [x] **Custom-package detail** — Overview + modifications + designer note, Itinerary days timeline with edit/delete per day + "Copy from base" action, edit form, sticky sidebar with Total price + price-difference vs base + Secure-client-link copy box + Inquiry link + Validity card
- [x] **Contact-message detail** — message body, reply form, amber-tinted Internal notes form, sticky From-customer info card
- [x] **Review moderation detail** — review body + star rating, attached photos grid, rejection-reason card (when rejected), sticky sidebar with Approve/Reject/Delete actions + Reviewer info + Package context
- [x] **Destinations / Activities / Accommodations detail** — hero image, About + Wildlife/Climate/Requirements/Amenities cards, Gallery grid, Rooms table (accommodations), sticky Quick-facts sidebar; topbar actions for "Public page" + "Edit"
- [x] Per-entity action menus in topbar (Edit / Cancel booking / Send quote / Delete message etc.)

### Phase 7.5 — Special workflows (2 days)
Branch: `feature/dashboard-workflows` → PR → `develop`
- [x] **Reviews moderation** — approve_confirm (emerald), reject_confirm (rose + reason textarea), delete_confirm (rose, permanent warning)
- [x] **6 catalog delete confirms** — destinations, activities, accommodations, packages, departures, custom-itinerary; fixes pre-existing bug where `packages/views.py` rendered `delete_confirm.html` but only `delete.html` existed
- [x] **Booking cancel confirm** — amber-tinted, inline cancellation-reason textarea, "Keep booking" escape hatch
- [x] **Custom-package builder** — 4-section staff form (Basics / Pricing / Modifications &amp; notes / Validity &amp; media) on 2-col layout with inquiry + base-package context in sidebar
- [x] **AI Assistant home** — 4 stat cards + 4 action tiles + setup-required banner if no AI config
- [x] **AI brochure parser** — upload form + result page with auto-refresh while running, JSON preview, copy-to-clipboard
- [x] **AI itinerary generator** — trip parameters form + result page with copy-to-clipboard
- [x] **AI route optimiser** — destinations input + ordered numbered-list result
- [x] **AI quote suggestions result** — match-score cards with reasoning
- [x] Shared `_confirm_action.html` reference partial documenting the icon + color variant pattern
- [ ] Booking status workflow transition guards — deferred (UI hides Cancel when already cancelled; deeper guards belong in `Booking.save()` not template)

### Phase 7.6 — Polish + a11y + cleanup (1–2 days)
Branch: `feature/dashboard-polish` → PR → `develop`
- [x] **Migrated last 8 templates** off `backend/base.html`: departures list, 3 add-image forms (destinations/activities/accommodations), add-room form, custom-itinerary copy + custom-package send confirm
- [x] **Deleted `templates/backend/base.html`** + legacy index/sidebar/topbar partials + obsolete `packages/dashboard/delete.html`
- [x] **Deleted `static/backend/`** — **54 MB → 1.5 MB** (97% reduction). All Bootstrap admin theme libs, jQuery plugins, Sass sources, demo images removed.
- [x] **Mobile audit** at 390×844 — sidebar off-canvas (`x: -256`), hamburger toggle slides it in (`x: 0`), Alpine state works correctly
- [x] **Perf budget**: HTML 20 KB · Tailwind 69 KB · Alpine 44 KB · Chart.js 201 KB (loaded per-page only). ~330 KB uncompressed, ~100 KB gzipped on dashboard home.
- [x] **3 polish tests** asserting (a) no template extends `backend/base.html` anymore, (b) `templates/backend/base.html` is deleted, (c) `static/backend/` is deleted
- [x] Skip-to-content link + focus-visible rings already wired in Phase 6.0 base — verified working on dashboard
- [ ] Toast notifications via Alpine — deferred (current Django messages renderer works fine; toast would be polish only)
- [ ] Lighthouse run — deferred (needs login; user can run from Chrome DevTools and report any reds)

**Phase 7 complete.** All dashboard routes live on `base_dashboard.html`. Total assets purged: **107 MB → 2.7 MB** across Phase 6 + Phase 7.

**Total estimate:** 13–17 focused days, 7 PRs to `develop`.

## Phase 8 — Dashboard Polish (post-launch audit findings)
> Triggered by a senior-dev audit of the Phase 7 dashboard. P0 = real bugs.
> P1 / P2 are NOT pre-planned — they will be re-evaluated after 2 weeks of
> real-data use, so this list stays as a backlog not a roadmap.

### P0 — bugs (must fix)

- [x] **Topbar `{% block %}` inside `{% include %}` partial** — `topbar_extras` and `topbar_search` block declarations lived in `_dashboard_topbar.html`, which is `{% include %}d` into the base. Django blocks do not cross include boundaries, so every "+ New X" CTA on ~16 dashboard pages was silently dropped. Inlined the topbar into `base_dashboard.html`, deleted the partial. Regression test added.
- [x] **Package `delete_confirm.html` missing** — view rendered `delete_confirm.html` but only `delete.html` existed → `TemplateDoesNotExist` on every package delete. (Fixed in Phase 7.5 / PR #26.)
- [x] **Empty dashboard has no onboarding** — fresh staff sign-in shows flat-zero KPIs + "No X yet" everywhere with no next-step guidance. Added a get-started checklist card on the dashboard home (4 steps: destination → activity → lodge → package) that tracks partial progress and auto-hides once all four catalog buckets are seeded.

### P1 — UX friction (backlog, re-evaluate after 2 weeks of real use)
> Do NOT pre-build these. Each item gets re-scored once real data has flowed
> through the dashboard. Some will turn out to be non-issues in practice.

- [ ] **Package form is too long** — 23 fields in one screen; only 6 required. Candidate fixes: Alpine.js tabs (4 tabs) OR two-step (quick-draft → inline-edit detail).
- [ ] **No autosave / no unsaved-changes warning** — long forms lose work on accidental tab close. Add localStorage autosave + beforeunload guard.
- [ ] **Per-row action icons lack tooltips/aria-labels** — pencil/calendar/trash icons are functional but discovery-hostile. Add `title` + `aria-label`.
- [ ] **Inquiry detail crams management form into 280px sidebar** — move status/assign/priority actions into a topbar dropdown; keep sidebar read-only.
- [ ] **No bulk actions on list pages** — priority: Reviews (approve/reject), Newsletter (delete inactive), Contact messages (archive). Needs checkbox column + sticky bottom action bar.
- [ ] **List tables are not sortable** — header clicks do nothing; add `?sort=` query-string sorting with reusable template pattern.
- [ ] **Dashboard KPIs lack baseline context** — "Inquiries · 30d: 0" with no comparison feels inert when there's no prior period. Add baseline / target / last-quarter average.

### P2 — architecture (defer indefinitely; do not pre-plan)
> These were nice-to-haves in the audit. None of them block the product.
> If after a month of use they are still missed, then reconsider.

- [ ] **Keyboard shortcuts** — `g d`, `g p`, `n` (new), `/` (focus search), `?` (help).
- [ ] **Recently-viewed / "continue editing" affordance after save**
- [ ] **Global search** — `/dashboard/search/?q=` across packages, destinations, activities, lodges, bookings, inquiries
- [ ] **Saved filter views** — pin a personal filter as a sidebar shortcut
- [ ] **"Today" view on dashboard home** — departures today, deposits expiring 48h, inquiries unread >24h
- [ ] **Audit log per record** — who changed status from X to Y and when (simple-history or homegrown)
- [ ] **Custom-package builder save-as-draft / preview-before-create**
- [ ] **AI Assistant job cancellation** — long-running Celery jobs currently can't be cancelled from the UI

### Deferred from Phase 8 P0 itself

- [ ] **`templates/500.html` multi-line `{# #}` comment bug** — Django's `{# #}` comments are single-line only; the multi-line comment on lines 2-3 contains a literal `{% url %}` that the parser sees. Currently masked because tests don't usually hit 500. Not in P0 scope (pre-existing, doesn't affect functionality unless an actual 500 happens in DEBUG=False). Fix when touching the template anyway.

---

## Phase 9 — Strategic Differentiators (pre-launch must-haves)
> Decision (Session 028): the "wait 2 weeks before next phase" rule applies
> only to UX polish (Phase 8 P1 / P2). It does **not** apply to strategic
> feature gaps that determine whether the product is even worth selling.
>
> The product ships when this list is done. Adding scope here is allowed
> only with a deliberate "I'm extending the launch line" decision — no
> scope creep by accident.

### Launch line — definition of done

- [ ] **F1 Route templates** live + ≥8 seeded canonical Tanzanian routes (Northern, Southern, Migration, Honeymoon, Kilimanjaro+Safari, Zanzibar+Safari, etc.)
- [ ] **F2 Lodge proximity suggestion** working in the custom-package builder
- [ ] **F3 AI itinerary draft** (via existing `RouteOptimizationJob`) returning useful output for ≥3 sample inputs
- [x] **Real catalog data seeded** (PR #29) — `python manage.py seed_catalog` ships with the repo. Final counts: 22 destinations (18 TZ + 4 neighbour stubs) with 47 gallery images, 83 accommodations (82 with hero images), 27 activities, 9 tour packages with 82 itinerary days, 10 testimonials, 12 FAQs. ~350 MB image bundle committed across 5 batched commits. Idempotent via `update_or_create`; `--reset` and `--skip-images` flags supported. Real Tanzanian lodge operators (Singita, andBeyond, Four Seasons, Sayari, Sanctuary, Serena, Sopa, Elewana, Asilia, Lemala) with 2025-26 USD price bands.
- [ ] **UI loopholes audit** (Session 028 — see below) — all P0 items resolved
- [ ] **At least 1 friendly tour-operator agrees to be the first paying customer** (not just a feature checklist — the actual market test)

### UI loopholes audit — Session 028 user walk-through
> Hands-on walk-through of the dashboard + public site looking for: broken
> flows, missing buttons, confusing copy, dead links, layouts breaking on
> edge cases (mobile, empty data, very-long names, etc.).

- [ ] _to be filled in as the user reports findings — one bullet per issue with severity P0 / P1 / P2_

### F1 — Route templates  (highest ROI, lowest risk)
> Pre-built named itineraries staff clone-and-tweak. 80% of quotes look
> like one of 5-10 templates, so this is the single biggest quote-time
> reduction available.

- [ ] Add `is_template = BooleanField(default=False)` to `Package` model + migration
- [ ] Add `template_category` choices field: `northern_circuit`, `southern_circuit`, `migration`, `honeymoon`, `family`, `kilimanjaro`, `zanzibar_combo`, `custom`
- [ ] Filter on `/dashboard/packages/?type=templates` showing only templates
- [ ] "Start from template" CTA on inquiry detail → opens custom-package builder pre-populated from the chosen template (reuses existing `dashboard_custom_itinerary_copy` flow)
- [ ] Seed ≥8 canonical routes via a management command `python manage.py seed_route_templates`
- [ ] Public site: show templates on the homepage / packages index alongside regular packages (or filter them out — decide during build)
- **Effort**: 2-3 days

### F2 — Lodge proximity suggestion  (high ROI, low effort)
> When staff adds a destination to a custom itinerary, surface lodges
> within X km in a sidebar so they don't have to remember which lodges
> are near Tarangire vs. Manyara vs. Serengeti Central.

- [ ] Haversine helper in `accommodations/utils.py` (no PostGIS needed at ~50 lodges)
- [ ] API endpoint: `GET /api/v1/accommodations/near/?lat=X&lng=Y&radius_km=30`
- [ ] Sidebar partial in the custom-package builder consumes the endpoint via Alpine.js fetch
- [ ] Test: lat/lng = Serengeti Central returns the right cluster of lodges
- **Effort**: 1-2 days

### F3 — AI itinerary draft  (wires up existing model)
> `ai_assistant.RouteOptimizationJob` already exists architecturally —
> needs system prompt + Celery task + result rendering. Riskiest of the
> three because output quality depends entirely on prompt quality.

- [ ] Pre-flight: confirm `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in `.env` + budget plan (per-call cost × expected quotes/month)
- [ ] Build a strong system prompt with Tanzanian safari operational knowledge: park sequences, drive-time rules, seasonal awareness, lodge classification by budget tier, currency, common pitfalls (Loliondo restricted, western corridor wet-season closure, etc.)
- [ ] Few-shot examples sourced from F1's seeded route templates
- [ ] Celery task posts to OpenAI, parses structured JSON response (itinerary days, lodges, activities, drive times), saves to job result
- [ ] Result view renders editable itinerary + "Save as custom quote" CTA that converts to a `CustomPackage`
- [ ] Manual QA: 3 sample inputs (budget honeymoon 7d, family safari 10d, photographer migration trip) all return plausible output
- **Effort**: 3-5 days (variance on prompt quality)

### F4 — Drive-time matrix  (deferred — earn via F1 side-effect)
> Manually populated `(origin, destination) → drive_hours` table used to
> flag brutal drive days in custom itineraries.

- [ ] Model: `core.DriveTime(origin_dest_id, destination_dest_id, road_hours, flight_minutes_or_null, notes)`
- [ ] Populated organically as F1 templates are seeded — each template leg writes a row
- [ ] Custom-package builder flags any day with > 6 hr drive time as warning
- **Effort**: 2 hrs code (data accumulates from F1 work)

### F5 — Map view on client-facing quote PDF  (deferred)
> Render the route on a static map embedded in the quote PDF. Sells the
> quote visually.

- [ ] Pre-flight: audit current PDF generator + Mapbox Static API key
- **Effort**: 2-3 days. Do **not** start until F1-F3 are shipped.

### Pre-launch seed-data follow-ups (from PR #29)

- [ ] **Image optimisation pass** — most hero shots are 5-25 MB raw. Resize to ≤1920px wide + re-encode WebP at 80% quality → expect ~70% repo size reduction and meaningfully faster public-site loads. Script: a one-off `python manage.py optimise_seed_images` that walks `core/seed_data/images/` and rewrites in place.
- [ ] **Git LFS migration** — if the image footprint grows beyond ~500 MB after optimisation, migrate `core/seed_data/images/**` to LFS so the working tree stays lean. Currently fine on stock GitHub repos; revisit only if push timeouts return.

### Out of scope for launch

- ❌ Auto-routing algorithm from raw lat/lng (rejected — Session 028 — see mentor discussion)
- ❌ Phase 8 P1 items (autosave, bulk actions, sortable headers, tooltips, inquiry-sidebar redesign, KPI baselines) — re-evaluate post-launch with real usage data
- ❌ Phase 8 P2 items (keyboard shortcuts, global search, audit log, saved filters, "today" view) — re-evaluate post-launch
- ❌ Reviews moderation polish — basics work; revisit if reviews actually flow in
- ❌ Newsletter campaign sender — export-only is fine for launch
- ❌ Payment gateway (Stripe / M-Pesa) — manual payment tracking is sufficient for launch; gateway after first paying clients confirm the need

### Phase 9 total estimate
~10-14 focused days for F1+F2+F3 + data seeding + UI loopholes fixes, assuming no scope creep. 2-3 PRs to `develop`.

## Phase 10 — Enteipa launch: sales infrastructure (Session 028)
> Deliberate launch-line extension (per Phase 9 rule). Business decision:
> system launches as **Enteipa** — dual revenue: per-operator deployments
> (setup fee + monthly hosting) + Enteipa site as lead-gen/broker channel.
> These two features are what operators actually ask for in pitches.

- [x] **10.1 WhatsApp click-to-chat** (Session 028) — `WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_NUMBER` env var, `normalize_whatsapp_number()` helper, `{% whatsapp_url %}` tag, site-wide floating button with context-aware prefill (package name / inquiry reference), "Reply on WhatsApp" on dashboard inquiry + booking detail, prefer-WhatsApp badge on inquiry list. Plus `core.SiteSettings` singleton + Dashboard → System → Settings page so operators edit the number without shell access (dashboard → env → hidden fallback chain). 29 tests.
- [ ] **10.2 Invoice PDFs** — WeasyPrint + Docker deps; lean `Invoice` model (`INV-YYYYMMDD-NNNNN`, FK Booking, type, amount, snapshot fields — TRA wants numbered immutable invoices); `invoice_pdf.html` template with Enteipa letterhead + bank/M-Pesa payment instructions from `.env`; staff-only download + email-with-attachment actions on booking detail; `send_invoice_email()` in `packages/emails.py`.
- [ ] **10.3 WhatsApp Cloud API** — PARKED until BRELA certificate in hand (Meta business verification needs it). Automated inquiry confirmations + quote notifications via Celery. Free tier ~1,000 conversations/month is plenty.

### User-side action items (not code)
- [ ] Buy `enteipa.com` (Porkbun / Cloudflare Registrar) + Cloudflare free DNS
- [ ] Rent VPS (Hetzner CX32 recommended) + deploy
- [ ] BRELA registration (agent) — unlocks 10.3 + Meta verification
- [ ] Written commission agreement with a licensed operator
- [ ] Set real `WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_NUMBER` in production `.env`
